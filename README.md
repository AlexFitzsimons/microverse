# microverse
a very inefficient gravity simulator that doesn't work very well

instructions:
1) run the program, follow the instructions on the interface

2)click to apply tool to a point

3)press "s" to select still mass - the initial velocity is 0

4)press "m" to select mass - the initial velocity is randomly generated

5)wait until the simulator crashes!(This wont take long, add more particles to speed things up!)

note: I realise that the gravity is not quite correct einsteins theory of relativity is not the easiest to put into a code!

why am i writing this no one is going to see it anyway.lol
